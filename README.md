# Stop-Question-and-Frisk-Newyork
Data Analysis of 2012 data by NYPD in Stop, Question and Frisk program.
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest and one of the oldest municipal police departments in unite States,
with approximately 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians. It was established in 1845. The Stop-Question-and- Frisk (SQF) program 
of New York City’s Police Department is a policing tool in which, officers stopped and questioned thousands of pedestrians annually
and searched them for weapons and other contraband. 
In the past 25 years, the department has achieved spectacular declines in both violent and property crime, 
ensuring that the New York City has the lowest overall rate of major crimes in the last 25 largest cities in the country.
Data records from NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk database are publicly available for download. Data are collected from 2003.
Record layouts and code books for each year’s data are recorded in separate Excel spreadsheet format files. The most recent year’s spreadsheet, 
as well as a zip archive containing all year’s spreadsheets, are downloadable. The documentation archive may also contain statistical notes for the 
databases in the text file format. In this project we are using stop-and-frisk data for the year of 2012.
